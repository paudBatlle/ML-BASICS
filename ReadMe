# ML-BASICS

Welcome to **ML-BASICS**, a project where I commit to revising and studying fundamental concepts in **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** using **Python**. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of these areas and continuously improve my skills. I dedicate time to this project at least **once a week**.

**ML-BASICS** is my ongoing journey into mastering machine learning and deep learning concepts. If you're also revising or learning, I hope this repository can serve as a useful reference or a starting point for your own studies!

The project includes:

- **Weekly study and revision** of theoretical concepts.
- **Hands-on coding exercises** to implement and demonstrate key topics.
- **Exercises from [Deep-ML](https://deep-ml.com/)** â€“ a LeetCode-style platform for solving problems in **Linear Algebra**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning**.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into different sections corresponding to the topics being covered. Each section includes code implementations, and exercise solutions.

### 1. **Machine Learning**
   - Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
   - Feature engineering techniques
   - Model evaluation and performance metrics
   - Exercise solutions from the Deep-ML platform

### 2. **Deep Learning**
   - Neural network fundamentals
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), etc.
   - Techniques like regularization, optimization, and transfer learning
   - Hands-on coding projects and exercise solutions from Deep-ML

### 3. **Deep-ML Exercises**
   - [Deep-ML](https://deep-ml.com/) exercises focusing on:
     - **Linear Algebra**
     - **NLP**
     - **Machine Learning**
     - **Deep Learning**
   - Each exercise is thoroughly documented, including the approach, solution, and lessons learned.
